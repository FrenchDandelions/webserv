<p1>[Verse 1]</p1>
<p>You say, "I don't understand," and I say, "I know you don't"
<p>We thought a cure would come through in time, now, I fear it won't
<p>Remember lookin' at this room? We loved it 'cause of the light
<p>Now, I just sit in the dark and wonder if it's time
</p>
<p1>[Pre-Chorus]</p1>
<p>Do I throw out everything we built or keep it?
<p>I'm getting tired even for a phoenix
<p>Always risin' from the ashes
<p>Mendin' all her gashes
<p>You might just have dealt the final blow
</p>
<p1>[Chorus]</p1>
<p>Stop, you're losin' me
<p>Stop, you're losin' me
<p>Stop, you're losin' me
<p>I can't find a pulse
<p>My heart won't start anymore for you
<p>'Cause you're losin' me
</p>
<p1>[Verse 2]</p1>
<p>Every mornin', I glared at you with storms in my eyes
<p>How can you say that you love someone you can't tell is dyin'?
<p>I sent you signals and bit my nails down to the quick
<p>My face was gray, but you wouldn't admit that we were sick
</p>
<p1>[Pre-Chorus]</p1>
<p>And the air is thick with loss and indecision
<p>I know my pain is such an imposition
<p>Now, you're runnin' down the hallway
<p>And you know what they all say
<p>"You don't know what you got until it's gone"
</p>
<p1>[Chorus]</p1>
<p>Stop, you're losin' me
<p>Stop, you're losin' me
<p>Stop, you're losin' me
<p>I can't find a pulse
<p>My heart won't start anymore for you
<p>'Cause you're losin' me
<p>'Cause you're losin' me
<p>Stop (Stop) 'cause you're losin' me
</p>
<p1>[Post-Chorus]</p1>
<p>My heart won't start anymore
<p>(Stop 'cause you're losin' me)
<p>My heart won't start anymore
<p>(Stop 'cause you're losin' me)
</p>
<p1>[Bridge]</p1>
<p>How long could we be a sad song
<p>'Til we were too far gone to bring back to life?
<p>I gave you all my best me's, my endless empathy
<p>And all I did was bleed as I tried to be the bravest soldier
<p>Fighting in only your army, frontlines, don't you ignore me
<p>I'm the best thing at this party (You're losin' me)
<p>And I wouldn't marry me either
<p>A pathological people pleaser
<p>Who only wanted you to see her
<p>And I'm fadin', thinkin'
<p>"Do something, babe, say something" (Say something)
<p>"Lose something, babe, risk something" (You're losin' me)
<p>"Choose something, babe, I got nothing" (I got nothing)
<p>"To believe, unless you're choosin' me"
</p>
</p>
<p1>[Outro]</p1>
<p>You're losin' me
<p>Stop (Stop, stop), you're losin' me
<p>Stop (Stop, stop), you're losin' me
<p>I can't find a pulse
<p>My heart won't start anymore
</p>
