</p>
<p1>[Verse 1]</p1>
<p>Stand there like a ghost, shakin' from the rain, rain
<p>She'll open up the door and say, "Are you insane-ane?"
<p>Say, "It's been a long six months"
<p>And you were too afraid to tell her what you want, want
</p>
<p1>[Pre-Chorus]</p1>
<p>And that's how it works
<p>That's how you get the girl
<p>And then you say
</p>
<p1>[Chorus]</p1>
<p>"I want you for worse or for better
<p>I would wait forever and ever
<p>Broke your heart, I'll put it back together
<p>I would wait forever and ever"
<p>And that's how it works
<p>That's how you get the girl, girl, oh
<p>And that's how it works
<p>That's how you get the girl, girl
</p>
<p1>[Verse 2]</p1>
<p>Remind her how it used to be, be, yeah, yеah
<p>Of pictures in frames, of kisses on cheeks, cheeks
<p>Tеll her how you must have lost your mind, ooh
<p>When you left her all alone and never told her why, why
</p>
<p1>[Pre-Chorus]</p1>
<p>And that's how it works
<p>That's how you lost the girl
<p>And now you say
</p>
<p1>[Chorus]</p1>
<p>"I want you for worse or for better
<p>I would wait forever and ever (Ever and ever)
<p>Broke your heart, I'll put it back together (Put it back together)
<p>I would wait forever and ever (Ever and ever)"
<p>And that's how it works
<p>That's how you get the girl, girl, oh
<p>And that's how it works
<p>That's how you get the girl, girl, yeah, yeah
</p>
<p1>[Bridge]</p1>
<p>And you know
<p>That I don't want you to go
</p>
<p1>[Break]</p1>
<p>Remind me how it used to be
<p>Pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks
<p>And say you want me, yeah, yeah, 'cause
<p>And then you say
</p>
</p>
<p1>[Chorus]</p1>
<p>"I want you for worse or for better (Worse or for better)
<p>I would wait forever and ever (Ever and ever)
<p>Broke your heart, I'll put it back together
<p>I want you forever and ever (I want you forever and ever)"
<p>And that's how it works
<p>That's how you get the girl, girl ('Cause it's how it works)
<p>And that's how it works
<p>That's how you get the girl, girl (Get the girl, that's how it works)
<p>And that's how it works (Oh)
<p>That's how you get the girl, girl (Oh)
<p>And that's how it works
<p>That's how you get the girl, girl
</p>
<p1>[Outro]</p1>
<p>And that's how it works
<p>That's how you got the girl
</p>
