        Welcome to New York

    <div class="lyrics">
        <p1>[Verse 1]</p1>
        <p>Walkin' through a crowd, the village is aglow
        <p>Kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats
        <p>Everybody here wanted somethin' more
        <p>Searchin' for a sound we hadn't heard before
        <p>And it said
        </p>
        <p1>[Chorus]</p1>
        <p>"Welcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you"
        <p>Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
        <p>Welcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you
        <p>Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
        <p>It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat, beat forevermor–µ
        <p>The lights are so bright, but they never blind me, me
        <p>Welcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you
        <p>Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
        </p>

        <p1>[Verse 2]</p1>
        <p>When we first dropped our bags on apartment floors
        <p>Took our broken hearts, put them in a drawer
        <p>Everybody here was someone else before
        <p>And you can want who you want
        <p>Boys and boys and girls and girls
        </p>

        <p1>[Chorus]</p1>
        <p>Welcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you
        <p>Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
        <p>Welcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you
        <p>Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
        <p>It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat, beat forevermore
        <p>The lights are so bright, but they never blind me, me
        <p>Welcome to New York (New York), it's been waitin' for you
        <p>Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
        </p>

        <p1>[Bridge]</p1>
        <p>Like any great love, it keeps you guessing
        <p>Like any real love, it's ever-changing
        <p>Like any true love, it drives you crazy
        <p>But you know you wouldn't change anything, anything, anything
        </p>

        <p1>[Chorus]</p1>
        <p>Welcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you
        <p>Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
        <p>Welcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you
        <p>Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
        <p>It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat
        <p>The lights are so bright, but they never blind me
        <p>Welcome to New York, new soundtrack
        <p>It's been waitin' for you, welcome to New York
        <p>The lights are so bright, but they never blind me
        <p>Welcome to New York, so bright, they never blind me
        <p>Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
        </p>
